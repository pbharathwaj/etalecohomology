<p>Given a sheaf <span class="math">\(F:C^\circ\to\Set\)</span>, we can make <span class="math">\(F(G)\)</span> into a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-set: (first, <span class="math">\(G\)</span> acts on the left on <span class="math">\(G\)</span> by translation) <span class="math">\[g:F(G)\to F(G)\]</span> is defined to be the map induced by the map of left <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-sets <span class="math">\[G\to G: a\mapsto a g.\]</span> (Thanks to Hao and Bharathwaj for pointing out that the contravariance of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> makes this the natural left action, not <span class="math">\(a\mapsto a g^{-1}\)</span>!)</p>

Every sheaf <span class="math">\(F\)</span> on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is representable by <span class="math">\(F(G)\)</span> with the above action.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Given a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-set <span class="math">\(U\)</span>, we need to find a functorial isomorphism <span class="math">\[F(U)\to\Hom_C(U, F(G)).\]</span> We can write <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is a disjoint union of orbits <span class="math">\(U=\sqcup U_i\)</span>, and <strong>the sheaf property tells</strong> us that this decomposition induces a canonical isomorphism <span class="math">\(F(U)=\prod F(U_i)\)</span>. Thus, it suffices to show this for <span class="math">\(U\)</span> that consist of a single <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-orbit.</p>
<p>But then there is a covering of the form <span class="math">\(G\to U\)</span> (given by choosing an element <span class="math">\(u\in U\)</span> and letting <span class="math">\(G\)</span> act). The sheaf property says that <span class="math">\(F(U)\)</span> is idenfied with the the equalizer of <span class="math">\[F(G)\rightrightarrows F(G\times_U G).\]</span> Having chosen <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, let’s write <span class="math">\(U = G/H\)</span> for <span class="math">\(H\)</span> a subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Two elements of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> map to the same element of <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> if and only if they are in the same coset. Thus, an element of <span class="math">\(G\times_U G\)</span> has the form <span class="math">\((g, gh)\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(h\in H\)</span>. This gives an isomorphism of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-sets <span class="math">\[G\times_U G\to G\times H,\]</span> where the <span class="math">\(H\)</span> factor in the latter has a trivial <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-action. In other words, <span class="math">\[G\times_U G\cong \sqcup_{h\in H} G\]</span> as <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-sets. This admits a right <span class="math">\(H\)</span>-action that simply permutes the factors.</p>
<p>By the sheaf property, we conclude that <span class="math">\[F(G\times_U G)\cong \prod_{h\in H} F(G).\]</span> What are the maps <span class="math">\(F(G)\to \prod_HF(G)\)</span>? The first one is the diagonal map, while the second one is the product of the maps <span class="math">\(F(G)\to F(G)\)</span> given by the right action of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. The equalizer of the maps is precisely the <span class="math">\(H\)</span>-invariant part of <span class="math">\(F(G)\)</span>.(Question from Hao: Why is the first map diagonal and second map as claimed? )</p>
<p>Answer(Hao): Let <span class="math">\(\varphi: G \times H \to G \times_U \G : (g,h) \mapsto (g,gh)\)</span>. It is a isomorphism of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-sets. Let <span class="math">\(\pi_1, \pi_2\)</span> be the two projections from <span class="math">\(G \times_U G\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\pi_1 \circ \varphi(g,h) = g\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi_2 \circ \varphi(g,h) = gh\)</span>. Under the identification <span class="math">\(\Phi: F(G \times H ) \cong \prod_H F(G)\)</span>, each factor on the right hand side is the image of <span class="math">\(F(G \times \{h\})\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(h\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(G \times {h}\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math">\(G\)</span> canonically and we used this canonical isomorphism to define <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span>, so the first map <span class="math">\(F(G) \to F(G\times_U G)\)</span> is the diagonal. The second map on the h-piece of <span class="math">\(\prod_H F(G)\)</span> induced from <span class="math">\(g (\mapsto (g,h)) \mapsto gh\)</span>. Hence it corresponds to the action of <span class="math">\(h^{-1}\)</span> on <span class="math">\(F(G)\)</span>. So the second map is <span class="math">\(F(G)\)</span> hitted with all elements of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> on the right.</p>
<p>What is <span class="math">\(\Hom_C(G/H, F(G))\)</span>? Well, <span class="math">\(\Hom_C(G, S)\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the same as <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\Hom_C(G/H, F(G))\subset F(G)\)</span>. It is the subset consisting of elements of <span class="math">\(F(G)\)</span> that are fixed by <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, that is, <span class="math">\(\alpha\in F(G)\)</span> such that for all <span class="math">\(h\in H\)</span>, the map <span class="math">\(g\mapsto gh^{-1}\)</span> sends <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. Call this <span class="math">\(F(G)^{H}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This identifies <span class="math">\(F(U)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\Hom_C(U, F(G))\)</span>, as desired. QED</p>
<p><strong>Upshot</strong>: a sheaf on <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-set is a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-set, and a sheaf of abelian group is a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-module. (Be careful about profinite groups and continuity/discreteness conditions!)</p>

<p>Given a topological space <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, we have the category of open subsets, <span class="math">\(\Open(X)\)</span>.

(This is the <em>infinitesimal lifting property</em>.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Idea of Proof</strong>: To compare (1) and (2), we need only remark that the rank of <span class="math">\(\Omega^1_{U/X}\)</span> is an upper bound on the relative dimension, achieving it precisely when <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is smooth. To see that (1) and (3) are the same: suppose (1) is true and choose some local finite presentation <span class="math">\[B=A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_m).\]</span> Since we assume that <span class="math">\(\Omega_{B/A}^1=0\)</span>, we see from the usual formulae that (without loss of generality) <span class="math">\(f_1,\ldots,f_n\)</span> have the property that the Jacobian matrix <span class="math">\(|\partial f_i/\partial x_j|\)</span> is invertible (after possibly localizing slightly). In particular, There is a natural surjective map <span class="math">\[g:A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_n)\to B.\]</span> By the magic of flatness, are reduced to showing that <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is an isomorphism after base change to the residue field of <span class="math">\(x\in\Spec A\)</span>, so we may assume that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a field. The condition on <span class="math">\(\Omega^1\)</span> implies that <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is a product of finitely many separable field extensions, and similarly for <span class="math">\(A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_n)\)</span>. The only surjections here are given by projecting to factors, in which case they are also localization maps (at single elements). But adding one variable <span class="math">\(z\)</span> and a relation of the form <span class="math">\(zf=1\)</span> with <span class="math">\(f\)</span> invertible at <span class="math">\(u\)</span> does not change the fact that we have a presentation with Jacobian invertible at <span class="math">\(u\)</span>.</p>
<p>To see that (4) is equivalent to the others: first, reduce to the case in which everything in sight is affine. The universal property of <span class="math">\(\Omega^1_{X/U}\)</span> shows that any diagonal lift is unique, so it remains to show that it exists, and we can check this locally (by uniqueness). Using an expression of the form <span class="math">\(B=A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_n)\)</span>, we can study lifts by lifting the <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>. So we need to understand how to ensure that we can choose lifts satisfying the equations <span class="math">\(f_1,\ldots,f_n\)</span>. Well, two lifts <span class="math">\[\mathbf{x}:=(\widetilde{x}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{x}_n)\]</span> and <span class="math">\[\mathbf{x}&#39;:=(\widetilde{x}&#39;_1,\ldots,\widetilde{x}&#39;_n)\]</span> in <span class="math">\(A^n\)</span> differ by an element of <span class="math">\(I^n\)</span>, say <span class="math">\[\mathbf{x}&#39;=\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{i}.\]</span> Using calculus, we see that the vectors <span class="math">\[\underline f(\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \underline f(\mathbf{x}) + J\mathbf{i}.\]</span> Since <span class="math">\(J\)</span> is invertible, we can arrange for a lift satisfying <span class="math">\(\underline f(\mathbf{x})=0\)</span>, as desired.</p>
<p>To go in the other direction, start with <span class="math">\(B=A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_m)\)</span>. Lifts are determined by lifting the images of the <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> as before. If the Jacobian is not invertible near <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, we can generate equations for a square <span class="math">\(0\)</span> extension that does not admit a lifting: just see what the Jacobian can do and force yourself to exist outside of its image! Once the unique lifting property holds, we end up having <span class="math">\(B=A[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots,f_n)\)</span> near <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, as before, and this algebra happens to be flat, which finishes the equivalence.

</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. First, let’s treat the case of a finite covering <span class="math">\(\{\Spec B_i\to\Spec A\}\)</span> of affines. The ring extension <span class="math">\(A\to\prod B_i\)</span> is thus faithfully flat. The sheaf condition is equivalent to the statement that the diagram <span class="math">\[A\to B\rightrightarrows B\tensor_A B\]</span> is exact (i.e., <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the equalizer of the two maps from <span class="math">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\tensor_A B\)</span> given by sending <span class="math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="math">\(b\tensor 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\tensor b\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Here’s a great trick. <strong>Remember this trick for the rest of your lives</strong>. To check that the sequence is exact, it is enough (in fact, it is equivalent) to check that the base change of the sequence to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is exact, <em>because <span class="math">\(A\to B\)</span> is faithfully flat</em>. What is this good for? Well, if we replace the starting map <span class="math">\(A\to B\)</span> with <span class="math">\(B\to B\tensor_A B\)</span>, then we end up with a faithfully flat ring map <span class="math">\(A&#39;\to B&#39;\)</span> that admits a retraction <span class="math">\(B&#39;\to A&#39;\)</span>. In other words, we may assume that there is a map <span class="math">\(B\to A\)</span> retracting <span class="math">\(A\to B\)</span>, which means that there is a decomposition <span class="math">\(B=A\oplus M\)</span> with <span class="math">\(M\)</span> a faithfully flat <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-module.</p>
<p>The sequence of interest now becomes <span class="math">\[A\to A\oplus M\rightrightarrows (A\oplus M)\tensor_A(A\oplus M),\]</span> which we can write as <span class="math">\[A\to A\oplus M\rightrightarrows A\oplus M\oplus M\oplus M\tensor_A M,\]</span> and now the last two arrows send <span class="math">\((a, m)\)</span> to <span class="math">\((a, m, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((a, 0, m)\)</span>. The only way these can be the same is if <span class="math">\(m=0\)</span>, as desired.QED</p>

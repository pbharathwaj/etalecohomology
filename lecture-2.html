<dd class="math">
<p>A <em>Grothendieck topology</em> is a category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> with a collection of coverings <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}{i\in I}\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(U\in C\)</span> such that</p>

<li>Any isomorphism is a covering.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a covering, and for each <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we have a covering <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U_i\}\)</span>, the total collection <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U\}\)</span> is a covering.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a covering and <span class="math">\(V\to U\)</span> is arbitrary, then each <span class="math">\(U_i\times_U V\)</span> exists and <span class="math">\(\{U_i\times V\to V\}\)</span> is a covering.</li>

Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of <span class="math">\(C^\infty\)</span>-manifolds, and say that a covering is a collection of submersions <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sqcup U_i\to U\)</span> is surjective. One funny quirk: a submersion has local sections everywhere. Does this mean that this topology can be compared to the classical one somehow? For example, do they have the same sheaves?

<p>We can modify the above example: fix a manifold <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and define the category of interest to be maps of manifolds <span class="math">\(Y\to X\)</span> that are everywhere local isomorphisms.

<h3 id="the-canonical-topology">The canonical topology</h3>
<p>Every category comes with a <em>canonical</em> topology.</p>
<div class="definition math">
<dl><dt class="math">Definition 8</dt>
<dd class="math">
A morphism <span class="math">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> in a category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is an <em>epimorphism</em> if for any two morphism <span class="math">\(g_1, g_2: Y \to Z\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(g_1=g_2\)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>An alternative way to say this is that a morphism <span class="math">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> is an epimorphism if the <span class="math">\(\Hom(-,Z)\)</span> functor sends <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to an injection: <span class="math">\[ \forall Z \in C, \Hom(Y, Z) \hookrightarrow \Hom(X,Z). \]</span></p>
In the category of sets, epimorphism are surjective maps. In the category of rings however, the map <span class="math">\(\mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Q}\)</span> is an epimorphism but not a surjection.
</div>
<div class="definition math">
<dl><dt class="math">Definition 9</dt>
<dd class="math">
In a category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> that admits fiber products, an epimorphism <span class="math">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> is <em>effective</em> if for all <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, the diagram <span class="math">\[\Hom(Y,Z)\to\Hom(X,Z)\rightrightarrows\Hom(Y\times_X Y, Z).\]</span> is exact.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Another way to view this property is to say that the following diagram is both Cartesian and Cocartesian, i.e. that the fiber product is the limit and that <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is the colimit:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  X \times_Y X &amp; \rightarrow  &amp; X \\
  \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow \\
  X &amp; \rightarrow &amp; Y
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
In an abelian category all epimorphisms are effective. For an example of an epimorphism that is not effective consider the identity map between the real line with the discrete topology and the real line with the standard topology. This map is continuous and since it is surjective it is an epimorphism. This is not an effective epimorphism since the diagram above fails to be Cocartesian. The map from the discrete line to itself that swaps two points does not factor through the standard line. Another example is the map <span class="math">\(\mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Q}\)</span> from before.

An effective epimorphism is <em>universal</em> if it is stable under base change, i.e. given a map <span class="math">\(W \to Y\)</span> the map <span class="math">\(X \times_Y W \to W\)</span> is also an effective epimorphism.

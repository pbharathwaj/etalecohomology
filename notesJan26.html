<h3 id="some-examples-of-azumaya-algebras">Some examples of Azumaya algebras</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(R\)</span> be a (unital) ring such that <span class="math">\(2\in R^{\times}\)</span> and let <span class="math">\(a,b \in R^{\times}\)</span>. Inspired by quaternion algeras, one can define an algebra <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> generated over <span class="math">\(R\)</span> by <span class="math">\(i,j\)</span> with the relations <span class="math">\[i^2 = a, j^2 = b, ij+ji = 0\]</span>. One can check that it gives rise to an Azumaya algebra over <span class="math">\(\tetxt{Spec}R\)</span>, as it splits over <span class="math">\(R[\alpha]/(\alpha^2 - a)\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, consider the algebra <span class="math">\(A = (-1,-1)\)</span> over <span class="math">\(\mathbf{Z}[1/2]\)</span>. Since the generic fiber <span class="math">\((-1,-1)_{\amthbf{Q}}\)</span> is not split, then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is not trivial, yet one can see that for every closed point <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{p}\in\text{Spec}\mathbf{Z}[1/2]\)</span> the algebra <span class="math">\((-1,-1)_{k(\mathfrak{p})}\)</span> is trivial. Also, for every prime <span class="math">\(p\neq 2\)</span>, the algebra <span class="math">\((-1,-1)_{\mathbf{Z}_p}\)</span> is trivial.</p>

<div class="definition math">
<dl><dt class="math">Definition 1</dt>
<dd class="math">
Let <span class="math">\(X\)</span> be a scheme. The Brauer group of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is the set of Azumaya algebras on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> modulo the following equivalence: <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\sim\mathcal{B}\)</span> if there are two locally free nowhere zero sheaves <span class="math">\(V,W\)</span> of finite rank such that <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\oplus\mathcal{E}nd(V)\simeq\mathscr{B}\oplus\mathcal{E}nd(W)\)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>This is actually a group, and the group operation is given, as one can imagine, by taking the tensor product of two Azumaya algebras.</p>
<p>A few remarks: - We have that <span class="math">\[\mathscr{E}nd(V)\otimes\mathscr{E}nd(W)\simeq\mathscr{E}nd(\otimes W)\]</span>, just like <span class="math">\(M_n(k)\otimes_k M_m(k)\simeq M_{mn}(k)\)</span>. - The identity element of <span class="math">\(Br(X)\)</span> is the class of <span class="math">\(\mathscr{O}_X\)</span>: indeed, one can check that <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\sim\)</span> _X$ iff there is a locally free sheaf <span class="math">\(V\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\simeq \mathscr{E}nd(V)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\)</span> is trivial. - If <span class="math">\(X=\text{Spec} k\)</span> for some field <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, then an Azumaya algebra on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> corresponds to a central simple algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(Br(X)\simeq Br(k)\)</span>.</p>
<p>As for computing inverses, exactly like in the case of central simple algebras over a field, there is an isomorphism <span class="math">\[
\mathscr{A}\otimes \mathscr{A}^o \to \mathscr{E}nd(\mathscr{A})
\]</span> Thus <span class="math">\([\mathscr{A}^o] = -[\mathscr{A}]\)</span> in <span class="math">\(Br(X)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Actually, one can prove that <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\sim \mathscr{B}\)</span> iff <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\otimes\mathscr{B}^o \simeq \mathscr{E}nd(V)\)</span> for some locally free sheaf <span class="math">\(V\)</span> of finite rank.</p>
<p>We will see that the Brauer group of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbf{C}}\)</span> is trivial: this really means that any Azumaya algebra on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbf{C}}\)</span> is the endomorphism ring of a locally free sheaf!</p>
<h3 id="structure-theory">Structure theory</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\)</span> be an Azumaya algebra on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> of rank <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span>: we say that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the degree of <span class="math">\(\mathscr{A}\)</span>. In the same way as we did for central simple algebras, we can define a functor <span class="math">\[
I: Sch_X\to \Set
\]</span> by <span class="math">\(I(Y) = Isom_Y(\mathscr{A}_Y, \mathscr{M}_n(\mathscr{O}_Y))\)</span>. Observe that <span class="math">\(I\to X\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(PGL_n\)</span>-torsor, and the same argument as in the case of fields allows us to get bijections from <span class="math">\(H^1(X_{et}, PGL_n)\)</span> to the set of Azumaya algebras of degree <span class="math">\(n\)</span> on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and to the set of all proper smooth morphisms <span class="math">\(P\to X\)</span> that etale-locally look like <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}^n_X\to X\)</span>.</p>

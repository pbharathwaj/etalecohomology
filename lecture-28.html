<p>** Bens Question ** Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be a complex group scheme. What quasi-coherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span> coorrespond to characters? Answer: Quasi-coherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span> correspond precisely to representations of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. In this correspondence, the group characters are exactly the invertible sheaves. In other words <span class="math">\(\textnormal{Pic}(G) = \widehat{G}\)</span>.</p>
<p>** Bens Other Question ** What does semisimplicity correspond to? Answer: Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be a group scheme. Then <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is semisimple if and only if for all quasicooherent sheaves <span class="math">\(F\)</span> on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span>, and for all <span class="math">\(i&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(H^i(BG,F) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>** Chriss Question ** What is <span class="math">\(H^0(BG,F)\)</span>? Answer: Last time we showed that <span class="math">\(\pi_*F = F^G\)</span> for <span class="math">\(\pi: BG\rightarrow X\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\(H^0(BG,F) = H^0(X,\pi_*F) = F(X)^G\)</span>.</p>
<p>** Missions Last Time ** What are the sheaves on <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\)</span> with trivial stabilizer action? We argued that <span class="math">\(\pi: BG\rightarrow X\)</span> satisfies <span class="math">\(pi^*\pi_* = \text{id}_{BG}\)</span> and therefore that <span class="math">\(\pi^*\)</span> defines an equivalence of categories between the category of quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> and the category of quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span> with trivial action. What about for <span class="math">\(\pi: \mathcal{X}_A\rightarrow X\)</span>?</p>
<p>** Claim ** <span class="math">\(\pi^*\)</span> also gives an equivalence of categories <span class="math">\(\text{Qcoh}(X)\rightarrow \text{Qcoh}(\mathcal{X}_A)^0\)</span></p>
<p>We saw that the construction of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\)</span> also comes equipped with a natural locally free sheaf <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathcal X_A\)</span> of rank equal to the rank of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. We briefly recall its definition: Morphisms <span class="math">\(T\rightarrow \mathcal{X}_A\)</span>, correspond to trivializations <span class="math">\((V,\varphi)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(V\)</span> a locally free sheaf on <span class="math">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> an isomorphism <span class="math">\(\mathcal{End}(V)\rightarrow A_T\)</span>. Using this correspondence, <span class="math">\(\mathcal V\)</span> is defined by <span class="math">\[\mathcal{V}: (V,\varphi) \mapsto \Gamma(T,V).\]</span></p>
<p>Now set <span class="math">\(\mathcal A = \mathcal{End}(\mathcal{V})\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is a quasi-coherent sheaf of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}_A}\)</span>-algebras. This has scalar <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span>-action! Why? The current note-takers understanding is that the reason is the following: The action of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span> is by scalar multiplication, so as a representation, <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span> decomposes into a direct sum <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}\cong\chi^{\oplus n}\)</span> (with <span class="math">\(n\)</span> the rank of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>). Therefore since <span class="math">\(\chi^{\oplus n}\otimes \chi^* = k^n\)</span>, we have that <span class="math">\[\mathcal{End}(V)\cong \mathcal{End}(k^n),\]</span> the latter set having trivial action.</p>
<p>The projection then defines an iso. <span class="math">\(\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{V})\cong \pi^*A\)</span>, and since <span class="math">\(\pi^*\)</span> is an equivalence, we see that <span class="math">\(\pi_*\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{V})\cong A\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, the situation is even better than this. Take any locally free sheaf <span class="math">\(\mathcal{W}\)</span> of rank <span class="math">\(n\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span> acts on by scalar multiplication. Then <span class="math">\[\mathcal{End}(\mathcal V)\otimes\\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{M})\cong \mathcal{End}(\mathcal W)\otimes\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{N})\]</span> for <span class="math">\(\mathcal M = \mathcal{Hom}(\mathcal{W},\mathcal{V})\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal N = \mathcal{Hom}(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W})\)</span>. The fact that <span class="math">\(\mathcal M\)</span> has trivial action implies that <span class="math">\(\pi_*\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{M}) = \mathcal{End}(\pi_*\mathcal{M})\)</span> and similarly for <span class="math">\(\mathcal N\)</span>. Hence we see that: <span class="math">\[\pi_*\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{V})\otimes\mathcal{End}(\pi_*\mathcal{M})\cong \pi_*\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{W})\otimes\mathcal{End}(\pi_*\mathcal{N})\]</span> Thus <span class="math">\(\pi_*\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{V})\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi_*\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{W})\)</span> are (Morita) equivalent (ie. belong to the same class in the Brauer group of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>).</p>
<p>** Basic Theorem ** <span class="math">\(\pi_*\)</span> defines an equivalence between things of the form <span class="math">\[\{\mathcal{End}(\mathcal{W}): \mathcal{W}\ \text{locally free, finite rank on $\mathcal{X}_A$ with scalar $\mathbb{G}_m$-action}\}\]</span> and the set <span class="math">\[\{\text{Azumaya algebras $\mathcal B$ on $X$ isomorphic to $A$}\}\]</span></p>
<p>** Claim ** If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are equivalent Azumaya algebras, then <span class="math">\(\mathcal X_A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal X_B\)</span> are isomorphic as <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span>-gerbs over <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. Justification: Assume <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are equivalent. Then there exists locally free <span class="math">\(\mathcal O_X\)</span>-modules <span class="math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span> on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(A\otimes\mathcal{End}(V) \cong B\otimes \mathcal{End}(W)\)</span>. Without loss of generality, may take <span class="math">\(W = \mathcal O_X\)</span>. In this case define <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\rightarrow\mathcal{X}_B\)</span> by <span class="math">\[(V_0,\varphi_0)\mapsto (V_0\otimes V,\varphi_0\otimes\mathcal{End}(V)).\]</span> Max remarks: this is like a dismembered head on a turtle â€“ it is just going.</p>
<p>In this way, the association <span class="math">\(A\mapsto \mathcal{X}_A\)</span> defines an injection <span class="math">\[\text{Br}(X)\hookrightarrow \{\text{iso classes of $\mathbb{G}_m$-gerbes on $X$}\} = H^2(X,\bbg_m).\]</span> (The last equality comes from the fact that we can make gerbes from derived functor cohomology)</p>
<p>** A down-to-earth version of this map ** Our old universal trivialization of an Azumaya algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is as the <span class="math">\(\mathbb{PGL}_n\)</span>-torsor <span class="math">\(V\rightarrow X\)</span> represented by the isom functor <span class="math">\[T\mapsto \text{Isom}_{$T$-\text{alg}}(\sheaf O_T^n,A_T).\]</span> In other words, the old universal trivialization gives us an element of <span class="math">\(H^1(X,\mathbb{PGL}_n)\)</span>. The new universal trivialization gives us an element of <span class="math">\(H^2(X,\mathbb{G}_m)\)</span>. How do we relate these? By Skolem-Noether, we have a short exact sequence of group schemes <span class="math">\[1\rightarrow\mathbb{G}_m\rightarrow\mathbb{GL}_n\rightarrow\mathbb{PGL}_n\rightarrow 1\]</span> Then France (Giraurd) tells us we get a long exact sequence of pointed sets <span class="math">\[H^1(X,\mathbb{G}_m)\rightarrow H^1(X,\mathbb{GL}_n)\rightarrow H^1(X,\mathbb{PGL}_n)\xrightarrow{\delta} H^2(X,\mathbb{G}_m).\]</span> Here this last map <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> sends a <span class="math">\(\mathbb{PGL}_n\)</span>-torsor to the stack of reductions of the structure group of <span class="math">\(T\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{GL}_n\)</span>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that everyone read Barbara Fantechi’s <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf">Stacks for Everybody</a></p>
<h3 id="reminder-definition-of-a-stack">Reminder: Definition of a Stack</h3>
<p>Recall the following definition: if <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is a site and <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a category fibered in groupoids over <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a <em>stack</em> if for all <span class="math">\(c \in C\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g, g&#39; \in G(c)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\text{Isom}(g,g&#39;) : C/c \rightarrow \underline{\text{Set}}\)</span> is a sheaf and for any cover <span class="math">\(d \rightarrow c\)</span>, descent is effective, i.e. <span class="math">\(G(c) \rightarrow D_{d/c}^G\)</span> is an equivalence.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-quasi-coherent-sheaves">Example 1: Quasi-coherent Sheaves</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of schemes with fppf topology, <span class="math">\(G\)</span> the category of quasi-coherent sheaves (one can see this is a CFG by thinking of the pseudo-functor sending schemes <span class="math">\(X\)</span> to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span>).</p>
<div class="theorem math">
<dl><dt class="math">Theorem 1</dt>
<dd class="math">
<span class="math">\(G \rightarrow C\)</span> is a stack.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Given any scheme <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and quasi-coherent sheaves <span class="math">\(Q_1, Q_2\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\text{Isom}(Q_1, Q_2) : \text{Sch}_X \rightarrow \underline{\text{Set}}\)</span> sending <span class="math">\(Y \rightarrow X\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\text{Isom}(Q_1|_Y, Q_2|_Y)\)</span> is an fppf sheaf on <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, in fact a subsheaf of the Hom sheaf: <span class="math">\(f : Q_1 \rightarrow Q_2\)</span> is an isomorphism if and only if there exists a <span class="math">\(Y \rightarrow X\)</span> an fppf cover such that <span class="math">\(f_Y\)</span> is an isomorphism.</p>
<p>Next, descent is effective for quasi-coherent sheaves; this was shown last quarter: reduce to the affine case and use Grothendieck’s trick.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-sheaves">Example 2: Sheaves</h3>
<p>We don’t need to restrict the above to quasi-coherent sheaves. If <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is the category of schemes, <span class="math">\(G\)</span> the category of all sheaves, then <span class="math">\(G \rightarrow C\)</span> also forms a stack.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-torsors">Example 3: Torsors</h3>
<p>If <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is any site, <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span> a sheaf of groups on <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, then define for each <span class="math">\(c \in C\)</span> <span class="math">\(B\Gamma(c)\)</span> to be the groupoid of left <span class="math">\(\Gamma|_c\)</span>-torsors in <span class="math">\(Sh(C/c)\)</span>. This consists of <span class="math">\(T\)</span> with a map <span class="math">\(\Gamma \times T \rightarrow T\)</span> such that: * “Whenever <span class="math">\(T\)</span> has a point <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, the map <span class="math">\(\Gamma \rightarrow T\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\gamma \mapsto \gamma t\)</span> is an isomorphism” * “<span class="math">\(T\)</span> has a point over a covering”</p>
<p>A subexample of this is <span class="math">\(C = \text{Sch}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Gamma = \mathbb{G}_m\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(B\mathbb{G}_m\)</span> is the groupoid of invertible sheaves on <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is also the stack of “representations of <span class="math">\(\Gamma\)</span>”, which is the stack of sheaves on <span class="math">\(B\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="example-4-quotient-stacks">Example 4: Quotient Stacks</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(X\)</span> be a scheme acted on by a group scheme <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Then define the stack <span class="math">\([X/G]\)</span> via sending <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> to the groupoid of <span class="math">\(\{Y \leftarrow T \rightarrow X \}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(T\rightarrow Y\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-torsor and <span class="math">\(T \rightarrow X\)</span> is <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-equivariant, where isomorphisms of such objects are isomophisms of the torsors where all diagrams commute.</p>
<p>The idea here is we are forming out of thin air an ideal quotient: <span class="math">\(X \rightarrow [X/G]\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-torsor and it is specifically constructed such that for any morphism <span class="math">\(Y \rightarrow [X/G]\)</span>, a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-torsor <span class="math">\(T\)</span> over <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> must have a compatible <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-map through <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>A concrete subexample of this is the action of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{A}^{n+1}/\{0\}\)</span> via <span class="math">\(\gamma(a_1, \dots, a_{n+1}) = (\gamma^{p_1} a_1, \dots, \gamma^{p_{n+1}} a_{n+1})\)</span> where the <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>’s are some power.</p>

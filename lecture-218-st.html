<h1 id="floppy-isom-is-not-a-scheme">Floppy Isom is Not a Scheme</h1>
<p>Given a scheme <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and an Azumaya algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> on <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, we’ve defined <span class="math">\(I_A\)</span> to be the stack of trivializations of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(I_A (T) = \{ V, \phi: End(V) \to A_T \}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is locally free on <span class="math">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is an isomorphism of algebras. This is a <span class="math">\(\mathbf{G}_m\)</span> gerbe, and we can ask ourselves: why is it not a scheme?</p>
<h3 id="clarifying-the-question">Clarifying the question</h3>
<p>Last quarter we showed that we can consider any $X Sch_S $ as a sheaf in the fppf site, and any sheaf has an associated stack: given <span class="math">\(F \in Sh(S)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is a functor (so a psuedofunctor) from <span class="math">\(S^{op}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(Set\)</span>, and any set is canonically a discrete groupoid (a groupoid with no non-identity arrows). In this setting, descent theory is equivalent to the sheaf condition, so descent theory is effective, so <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is a stack. Therefore, for any scheme, we can associate a sheaf to which we can associate a stack. So, when we ask, “why is <span class="math">\(I_A\)</span> not a scheme?”, we’re really asking, “why is <span class="math">\(I_A\)</span> not isomorphic to a stack associated to a sheaf associated to a scheme?” But, we could actually skip the scheme part and ask an intermediate question: “Why is <span class="math">\(I_A\)</span> not isomorphic to a stack associated to a sheaf?”<br />Note that when we discuss isomorphisms of stacks, we mean 1-isomorphisms. A morphism of stacks on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a morphism of categories fibered in groupoids over <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, and a 1-isomorphism is an equivalence of categories.</p>
<h3 id="answering-the-question">Answering the Question</h3>
<div class="proposition">
A stack <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is 1-isomorphic to the stack associated to a sheaf of sets if and only if (1) the fiber categories <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}(T)\)</span> are essentially small and (2) any <span class="math">\(x \in \mathcal{X}(T)\)</span> satisfies <span class="math">\(Aut(x) = \{id\}\)</span>.<br />
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong> An isomorphism <span class="math">\(F\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> would induce equivalences of fiber categories <span class="math">\(F(T) \cong \mathcal{X}(T)\)</span>, but the automorphisms of any object in <span class="math">\(F(T)\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\{id\}\)</span> because <span class="math">\(F(T)\)</span> is discrete.<br />Conversely, if these two conditions are satisfied, descent theory is equivalent ot the sheaf condition for objects. QED</p>
<p>Now, to show <span class="math">\(I_A\)</span> is not a sheaf, we observe that for any <span class="math">\(T \in Sch_S\)</span>, the automorphism group of any object in <span class="math">\(I_A(T)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\mathbf{G}_m\)</span>, which is not <span class="math">\(\{id\}\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(I_A\)</span> is not a sheaf.</p>
<p>We could also ask ourselves: is <span class="math">\(I_A(T)\)</span> essentially small? The answer here is yes; the category of finitely generated modules over a ring <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is essentially small, which implies the category of finitely generated quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is essentially small, which implies the category of locally free sheaves is essentiall small, which implies <span class="math">\(I_A(T)\)</span> is essentially small.</p>

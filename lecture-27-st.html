Recall we have two question:

<ol type="1">
<li>Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be a group scheme over <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Claim: Quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span> are equivalent to <span class="math">\(Reps^{Qcoh}(G)\)</span>, the (right) <span class="math">\(G\)</span> equivarient quasicoherent sheaves on schemes over <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. This equivalence is given by the functor that sends a quasicoherent sheaf <span class="math">\(F\)</span> to <span class="math">\(F(S)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The idea we had last time was to use that <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is flat and finitely presented over <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. Then we can use fppf descent. This left us with lots of questions about why it works. We will show the equivalence more directly here.</p>
<p>First we show that the functor described above is essentially surjective. Start with a quasicoherent sheaf <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> with an action <span class="math">\(Q \times G \to Q\)</span>. This is the same as a map <span class="math">\(G \to Aut_{\mathcal{O}}(Q)\)</span>. This induces a map <span class="math">\(H^1(T,G) \to H^1(T, Aut_{\mathcal{O}}(Q))\)</span>. In other words, given a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-torsor <span class="math">\(V \to T\)</span> we map to a sheaf <span class="math">\(Q&#39;_V\)</span> on <span class="math">\(T\)</span> that is a form of <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our claim is that this an <span class="math">\(F\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(F(S)\simeq Q\)</span>. There are a lot of things to check here, like is <span class="math">\(F\)</span> actually a functor, but we do not check it here. Two other important questions we might ask are why is <span class="math">\(F\)</span> quasicoherent and why does this give us the correct <span class="math">\(G\)</span> action.</p>
<p>One could ask if this equivalence descends to an equivalence between coherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span> and finite dimensional representations of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. The notion of coherent is perhaps not the correct notion and instead we should consider quasicoherent sheaves of finite presentation. Then since the correspondence <span class="math">\(F \mapsto f(S)\)</span> is fully faithful the answer will be yes.</p>
<p>(1.5) Before moving on to our second goal we first consider quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(BG\)</span> with trivial action. From the above discussion any quasicoherent sheaf corresponds to something with an action. Let <span class="math">\(Qcoh^0(BG)\)</span> be the collection of quasicoherent sheaves <span class="math">\(F\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(F(S) \times G \to F(S)\)</span> is given by the trivial action.</p>
<p>Claim: <span class="math">\(Qcoh^0(BG) \simeq Qcoh(S)\)</span>. More precisly if <span class="math">\(\pi: BG \to S\)</span> then the desired isomorphism is given by <span class="math">\(\pi^* \pi_* \to id\)</span>. We saw that <span class="math">\(F\)</span> comes from <span class="math">\(F(S)\)</span> by twisting via <span class="math">\(G \to Aut_{\mathcal{O}}(F(S))\)</span>.Given a map <span class="math">\(T \to BG\)</span> we have a torsor <span class="math">\(V \to T \to S\)</span> with <span class="math">\(p: V \to S\)</span>. Then we get <span class="math">\(F(T) \simeq p^*F(S)\)</span> by twisting by the cocycle giving <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. Because the action is trivial it doesn’t matter what the map <span class="math">\(V \to T\)</span> is so <span class="math">\(F \simeq \pi^*F(S)\)</span>.</p>
<p>How do we compute <span class="math">\(\pi_*\)</span>. Claim: Let <span class="math">\(\pi: BG \to S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F \in Qcoh(BG)\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\pi_* F \simeq F(S)^G\)</span>. We will use Yoneda’s lemma and adjointness. Let <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> be any quasicoherent sheaf on <span class="math">\(S\)</span> and consider <span class="math">\[
  Hom_S(Q, \pi_* F) = Hom_{BG}(\pi^*Q,F) = Hom_{Reps^{Qcoh}(G)}(Q(S),F(S)) = Hom_S(Q,F(S)^G)
\]</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>We now address our final question. <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\)</span> is almost <span class="math">\(B \mathbf{G}_m\)</span>. In laymans terms, choose a covering <span class="math">\(U \to S\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}|_U \simeq End(V)\)</span>. This gives us <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A|_U \simeq B \mathbf{G}_{m,U}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mission: show that quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}_A\)</span> with trivial action are precisly the pullbacks from <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="the-classical-setting">The classical setting</h3>
<p>First we consider the classical setting. Let <span class="math">\(X\)</span> be a proper scheme over a field <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and consider the moduli space of length one quasi-coherent sheaves with finite presentation (qcfp sheaves) on <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. We can define a moduli functor <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> can be defined as follows, for all <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-schemes <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M} ( T )\)</span> is the set of all qcfp sheaves <span class="math">\(F\)</span> on <span class="math">\(X_{T} =X \times_{k} T\)</span> such that</p>
<p>(M1) <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-flat (more generally <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-flat with <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-proper support)</p>
<p>(M2) if <span class="math">\(\bar{t} \to T\)</span> is a geometric point then <span class="math">\(F_{\bar{t}}\)</span> has length <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This defines a pseudofunctor / CFG.</p>
<p>Question: Is <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> a stack / sheaf / scheme?</p>
<p>The CFG <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is a sub-CFG of Qcoh<span class="math">\(( X/k )\)</span>, where the latter is a stack. To show that <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is a substack, we have to show that conditions (M1) and (M2) above are preserved by descent. Condition (M1) is preserved by descent since we can checkvflatness fppf locally. Condition (M2) is preserved since geometric point conditions automatically glue if they are invariant under algebraically closed field extensions.</p>
<p>Note: The notion of length is poorly behaved over non-geometric points.</p>
<p>We can rephrase condition (M2) equivalently as follows: (M2’) Let <span class="math">\(q:X_{T} \to T\)</span> be the projection, then <span class="math">\(q_{\ast} F\)</span> is locally free of rank <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that Condition (M2’) is compatible with base change.</p>
<div class="proposition">
<p>(M2) and (M2’) are equivalent conditions. &lt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong> Consider the following Cartesian square <span class="math">\[ \begin{array}{ccc} X_{\bar{t}} &amp; \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} &amp; X_{T}\\
_{\pi} \downarrow &amp;  &amp; \downarrow_{q}\\
\bar{t} &amp; \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} &amp; T \end{array} \]</span> where <span class="math">\(\bar{t}\)</span> is a geometric point of <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(F_{\bar{t}} =f^{\ast} F\)</span>. Suppose that <span class="math">\(F_{\bar{t}}\)</span> has length <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(k ( \bar{t} ) \simeq \pi_{\ast} f^{\ast} F \simeq g^{\ast} q_{\ast} F\)</span>. Hence the geometric fibres of <span class="math">\(q_{\ast} F\)</span> are one dimensional. (This should imply <span class="math">\(q_{\ast} F\)</span> is locally free, at least if <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is reduced and <span class="math">\(k= \bar{k}\)</span> this is clear). Conversely, suppose <span class="math">\(q_{\ast} F\)</span> is locally free of rank <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\pi_{\ast} F_{\bar{t}} \simeq g^{\ast} q_{\ast} F \simeq k ( \bar{t} )\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(F_{\bar{t}}\)</span> has length <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. QED.</p>
<h3 id="example-families">Example families</h3>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(q:X \times_{k} X \to X\)</span> where <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the second projection. Let <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}\)</span> be the structure sheaf of the closed subscheme <span class="math">\(\Delta \subseteq X \times_{k} X\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(q_{\ast}\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}\)</span> clearly satisfies (M1) and (M2) so <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}\)</span> is a family in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M} ( X )\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally, assume that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is separated. Given a section <span class="math">\(\alpha :T \to X \times T\)</span> of <span class="math">\(q:X \times T \to T\)</span>, the <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O}_{X_{T}}\)</span>-module <span class="math">\(\alpha_{\ast} \mathcal{O}_{T}\)</span> gives a family in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M} ( T )\)</span>.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p>The pseudofunctor <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> has the following alternative description. For every <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-scheme <span class="math">\(T\)</span>: <span class="math">\[ \mathcal{M} ( T )  =  \{ ( \alpha , \mathcal{L} ) \mid \alpha :T \to X_{T} , q \circ \alpha =1_{T} , \mathcal{L} \in Pic ( \alpha ( T ) ) \} . \]</span> &lt;&gt;</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>There is an isomorphism of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_{m}\)</span>-gerbes <span class="math">\[ \mathcal{M} \simeq B\mathbb{G}_{m} \times X. \]</span> &lt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Point of Proof</strong> This alternative description gives a map <span class="math">\(F \to Supp (F)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M \to X\)</span> that, together, imply the isomorphism above. QED.</p>
<p>Note: The stack <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is a ``floppification’’ of <span class="math">\({Hilb}^{1} ( X )\)</span>; alternatively one can view the punctual Hilbert scheme <span class="math">\({Hilb}^{1} ( X )\)</span> as a rigidification of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>; since <span class="math">\({Hilb}^{1} ( X )\)</span> classifies sheaves of length <span class="math">\(1\)</span> <span class="math">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> with the extra structure of a morphism <span class="math">\(\mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{T}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="extending-this-to-mathfrakx-twisted-sheaves">Extending this to <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>-twisted sheaves</h3>
<p>Question: Let <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X} \to X\)</span> be a <span class="math">\(\mathbb{G}_{m}\)</span>-gerbe over <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. What is the moduli space of length <span class="math">\(1\)</span> <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>-twisted sheaves? More generally, if <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{Y}\)</span> is an algebraic stack, is the moduli space of length <span class="math">\(1\)</span> sheaves on <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{Y}\)</span> isomorphic to <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{Y}\)</span>?</p>
<p>I think the answers are <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{Y}\)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>We conjectured in class that the moduli space of length <span class="math">\(1\)</span> <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>-twisted sheaves must be either <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(B\mathbb{G}_{m} \times X\)</span>. One way to distinguish the two is to determine if there is a global section over <span class="math">\(id: X \to X\)</span>, which corresponds to the existence of an invertible <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>-twisted sheaf.<br />But, such a sheaf exists if and only if <span class="math">\([ \mathfrak{X} ] = 0\)</span>. So, if <span class="math">\([ \mathfrak{X} ] \ne 0\)</span>, this moduli space certainly can’t be <span class="math">\(B\mathbb{G}_{m} \times X\)</span>, leading us to believe it is just <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="another-proof-that-mathrmbr-x-is-torsion">Another proof that <span class="math">\(\mathrm{Br} ( X )\)</span> is torsion</h3>
<p>Consider the cocycle formulation of twisted sheaves. Let <span class="math">\(U \to X\)</span> be a Cech hypercover, and <span class="math">\(a \in \mathbb{G}_{m} ( U \times_{X} U \times_{X} U )\)</span> be a cocycle with class <span class="math">\([ \mathfrak{X} ]\)</span>. A twisted sheaf is given by a sheaf <span class="math">\(F\)</span> on <span class="math">\(U\)</span> together with an isomorphism <span class="math">\(\varphi : \mathrm{pr}_{1}^{\ast} F \to \mathrm{pr}_{2}^{\ast} F\)</span> satisfying the <span class="math">\(a\)</span>-twisted cocycle equation. Let <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> be coboundary map, then <span class="math">\(\delta \varphi =a^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An Azumaya algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> with class <span class="math">\([ \mathfrak{X} ]\)</span> is given as the endomorphisms of locally free <span class="math">\(\mathfrak{X}\)</span>-twisted sheaf <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(A= \pi_{\ast} \mathcal{E} n d ( V )\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(\pi : \mathfrak{X} \to X\)</span>).</p>
<p>Restrict everything to <span class="math">\(U\)</span>: and call <span class="math">\(V \mid_{U} =V_{0}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\varphi_{0} : \mathrm{pr}_{1}^{\ast} V_{0} \to \mathrm{pr}_{2}^{\ast} V_{0}\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\delta \varphi =a^{-1}\)</span> so <span class="math">\(\mathcal{E} n d ( V_{0} )\)</span> descends.</p>
<div class="proposition math">
<dl><dt class="math">Proposition 1</dt>
<dd class="math">
Let <span class="math">\(r= \mathrm{rank} V\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(r [ \mathfrak{X} ] =0\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math">\(\mathrm{Br} ( X )\)</span> is torsion.

</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong> Let <span class="math">\(L_{0} = \det ( V_{0} )\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(\wedge^{r} \varphi : \mathrm{pr}_{1}^{\ast} L_{0} \to \mathrm{pr}_{2}^{\ast} L_{0}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\delta \wedge^{r} \varphi = \wedge^{r} \delta \varphi =a^{-r}\)</span>. Hence the data <span class="math">\(( L_{0} , \wedge^{r} \varphi )\)</span> give an invertible twisted sheaf for the cocycle <span class="math">\(a^{r}\)</span>. Hence <span class="math">\(r [ \mathfrak{X} ]\)</span> is trivial. QED.</p>
